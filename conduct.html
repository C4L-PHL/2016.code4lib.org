          <h1 class="conduct">Code of Conduct</h1>
          <p>Code4Lib seeks to provide a welcoming, fun, and safe community and
            conference experience as well as an ongoing community for everyone. We do not
            tolerate harassment in any form. Discriminatory language and imagery
            (including sexual) is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks,
          or any community channel such as the chatroom or mailing list.</p>
          <p>Harassment is understood as any behavior that threatens another person or
            group, or produces an unsafe environment.  It includes offensive verbal
            comments or non-verbal expressions related to gender, gender identity,
            gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
            body size, race, age, religious beliefs, sexual or discriminatory images
            in public spaces (including online), deliberate intimidation, stalking,
            following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
            talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
          attention.</p>
          <p>Conflict Resolution</p>
          <ol><li>Initial Incident
            <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
              or have any other concerns, <em>and you feel comfortable speaking with
              the offender</em>, please inform the offender that he/she/ze has affected you
              negatively. Oftentimes, the offending behavior is unintentional, and the
              accidental offender and offended will resolve the incident by having
            that initial discussion.</p>
            <p>Code4Lib recognizes that there are many reasons speaking directly to
              the offender may not be workable for you (including but not limited to
              unfamiliarity with the conference or its participants, <a href="http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/wpress/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/">lack of spoons</a>,
              and concerns for personal safety). If you don't feel comfortable
              speaking directly with the offender for any reason, skip straight to
            step 2.</p></li>
            <li>Escalation
              <p>If the offender insists that he/she/ze did not offend, if offender is
                actively harassing you, or if direct engagement is not a good option
              for you at this time, then you will need a third party to step in.</p>
              <p>If you are at a conference or other event, find an event organizer or
                staff person, who should be listed <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Main_Page">on the wiki</a>.
                If you can't find an event organizer, there will be other staff
              available to help if the situation calls for immediate action.</p>
              <p>If you are in the #code4lib IRC, the zoia command to list people
              designated as channel helpers is <strong>@helpers</strong>. At most times, there is at least one helper in the channel.</p>
              <p>For the listserv, you have a free-for-all for public messages; however,
                the listserv does have a maintainer, <a href="http://www3.nd.edu/~emorgan/">Eric Lease Morgan</a>.</p></li>
                <li>Wider community response to Incident:
                  <p>If the incident doesn't pass the first step (discussion reveals offense
                    was unintentional, apologies said, public note or community is informed
                    of resolution), then there's not much the community can do at this point
                  since the incident was resolved without outside intervention.</p>
                  <p>If incident results in corrective action, the community should support
                    the decision made by the Help in Step 2 if they choose corrective action,
                    like ending a talk early or banning from the listserv, as well as
                    support those harmed by the incident, either publicly or privately
                  (whatever individuals are comfortable with).</p>
                  <p>If the Help in Step 2 run into issues implementing the CoC, then the
                    Help should come to the community with these issues and the community
                  should revise the CoC as they see fit.</p>
                  <p>In Real Life people will have opinions about how the CoC is enforced.
                    People will argue that a particular decision was unfair, and others will
                    say that it didn't go far enough. We can't stop people having
                    opinions, but what we could do is have constructive discussions
                    that lead to something tangible (affirmation of decision, change in CoC,
                  modify decision, etc,).</p></li>
                  </ol><p>Sanctions</p>
                  <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
                    immediately.  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may
                    take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender,
                    expulsion from the Code4Lib event, or banning the offender from a chatroom
                  or mailing list.</p>
                  <p>Specific sanctions may include but are not limited to:</p>
                  <ul><li>warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports
                  will result in other sanctions</li>
                  <li>requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical
                  proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event</li>
                  <li>early termination of a talk that violates the policy</li>
                  <li>not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy</li>
                  <li>not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at
                  the event</li>
                  <li>immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the
                    harasser holds requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future Code4lib
                  events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)</li>
                  <li>requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return</li>
                  <li>banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a
                  certain time period)</li>
                  <li>publishing an account of the harassment</li>
                </ul><p>Code4Lib event organizers can be identified by their name badges, and will
                help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement,
                provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel
                safe for the duration of the event. Code4Lib IRC volunteers can be identified
              by issuing the <code>@helpers</code> command to the #code4lib bot named "zoia".</p>
